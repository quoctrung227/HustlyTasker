# HUSTLYTASKER HANDOVER

## Current checkpoint — 2026-10-18

Repository: `D:\da\HustlyTasker`

Branch: `main`

HEAD and local `origin/main`: `5e89971`

Current task: `HT-RBAC-P1-03 — COMPLETE / OWNER REVIEW GATE`

Read root `AGENTS.md` before taking action. Source, migrations, Git status and
current test output override historical notes. Do not commit, push, reset,
revert, clean, apply migrations or alter development data without owner
authorization.

### What was completed

- `HT-RBAC-DESIGN-P0-01` is `COMPLETE / ACCEPTED — APPROVED BY OWNER
  DELEGATION`. `RBAC_DESIGN.md` and `DECISION_LOG.md` record all 14 delegated
  decisions; do not ask the owner to decide them again.
- Added `backend/apps/workspace/access.py`:
  - resolver-produced immutable ID-only Profile/Workspace contexts;
  - active-User and active-ProfileMembership verification;
  - tenant-scoped Profile and Workspace selectors;
  - Profile Owner/Admin same-Profile Workspace inheritance;
  - ordinary Profile Member access only with explicit effective
    WorkspaceMember;
  - DB-revalidated read/edit/member-management capabilities;
  - generic `TenantAccessNotFound` for unknown/out-of-scope/malformed tenant
    identifiers;
  - fail-closed handling for direct construction, `dataclasses.replace()`,
    inactive/stale membership and stale Workspace role.
- Kept the existing WorkspaceMember schema vocabulary:
  - `ADMIN` = Workspace Admin;
  - `MEMBER` = Editor;
  - `VIEWER` = read-only Viewer;
  - legacy `OWNER` grants no capability through this boundary and is never
    assigned by the scoped service.
- Refactored `update_profile_membership()`:
  - signature now requires `profile_id`;
  - actor/Profile authorization precedes target lookup;
  - target is filtered inside the verified Profile;
  - Profile Admin may manage a current ordinary Member only and cannot grant
    or modify Admin/Owner;
  - Profile-first locking, last-active-owner, transitional Workspace-owner
    guard and atomic AuditLog behavior remain.
- Refactored `add_workspace_member()`:
  - signature requires `profile_id`, `workspace_id` and
    `target_profile_membership_id`; it no longer accepts a globally resolved
    User;
  - actor, Workspace, target ProfileMembership and active User are verified in
    the same Profile and rechecked under locks;
  - Profile Owner/Admin may grant `ADMIN`, `MEMBER` or `VIEWER`;
  - Workspace Admin may grant only `MEMBER` or `VIEWER` in its own Workspace;
  - Editor/Viewer cannot manage membership; no actor may grant legacy `OWNER`;
  - sequential/concurrent duplicates raise `WorkspaceMembershipConflict` and
    successful mutation writes exactly one audit event.
- Expanded Workspace tests for contexts, tenant isolation, IDOR-equivalent
  failures, stale/forged contexts, role ceilings, denied-audit behavior,
  last-owner protection and duplicate concurrency.
- Independent review found one medium context-forgery issue involving
  `dataclasses.replace()`. It was fixed with non-init provenance plus exact DB
  revalidation, regression tests were added, and follow-up review found no
  blocking/high/medium issue.

### Files changed in the worktree

Backend:

- `backend/apps/workspace/access.py` — new, untracked until the owner chooses to
  commit.
- `backend/apps/workspace/services.py`
- `backend/apps/workspace/tests.py`

Documentation:

- `documentation/CHANGELOG.md`
- `documentation/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`
- `documentation/DECISION_LOG.md`
- `documentation/HANDOVER.md`
- `documentation/PROGRESS.md`
- `documentation/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
- `documentation/PROJECT_ROADMAP.md`
- `documentation/RBAC_DESIGN.md`
- `documentation/REQUIREMENT_STATUS.md`

`API_DOCUMENTATION.md` is unchanged because no HTTP route or API contract was
added. No model or migration file changed.

### Verification actually run

Environment:

- Existing PostgreSQL 16 container `hustlytasker_postgres`; no container was
  created, replaced, stopped or reset.
- Existing local Python 3.12.5 virtualenv synchronized to pinned Django 6.1.2
  and DRF 3.18.3; no requirement file changed.

Final acceptance evidence after the independent-review fix:

- `python -m pip check`: PASS.
- Version assertion: Django 6.1.2 / DRF 3.18.3: PASS.
- Python compile for access/services/tests: PASS.
- `python manage.py check`: PASS, zero issues.
- `python manage.py makemigrations --check --dry-run`: PASS, no changes.
- `python manage.py test apps.workspace --noinput -v 1`: PASS, 51/51.
- `python manage.py test --noinput -v 1`: PASS, 80/80. This includes all 19
  Authentication and 10 API Foundation regressions.
- `git diff --check`: PASS (only existing LF-to-CRLF conversion warnings).
- Strict UTF-8/no-NUL/code-fence QA and secret-assignment scan: PASS for all
  changed code/documentation files.

Pre-fix diagnostic runs also passed 49/49 targeted and 78/78 full. They are
historical within this task and are not the final acceptance evidence.

Django created and destroyed only disposable `test_hustlytasker_db` databases.
It did not migrate the development database.

### Migration and data state

- Source still contains additive
  `workspace/0002_profile_workspace_foundation.py`; no migration was created or
  edited by HT-RBAC-P1-03.
- Read-only development PostgreSQL inventory on 2026-10-18 confirmed only
  `workspace.0001_initial` is applied. `workspace.0002` is unapplied.
- Development inventory: 3 User rows; 0 Workspace, WorkspaceMember, Task,
  Client, Invoice, Payment and AuditLog business rows. Profile tables do not
  exist in development because `0002` is unapplied.
- No development row was created, changed, deleted, reset or backfilled. The
  named volume was preserved.

### Security boundaries that still exist

- Direct ORM `.save()`/`.update()`, bulk operations, raw SQL and unsafe Django
  Admin paths can bypass the reviewed membership services. This task does not
  claim database-wide enforcement against privileged code.
- Django Admin remains a platform-operations surface. Tenant-wide business
  model access is for platform superusers only until tenant-scoped Admin exists.
- Direct `User.is_active` changes can bypass cross-Profile last-owner and
  session-revocation requirements. The approved account-deactivation service
  and established-session purge are not implemented.
- No Workspace/Profile API or DRF tenant permission class exists. The new
  exception is a service boundary that a future API must map without revealing
  object existence.
- No Invitation model/migration/service/API exists. Verified email/account
  binding is required before production Invitation; token hashing alone is not
  identity verification.
- No Client, Project, Finance, Audit, Task or Review tenant selector/API was
  added. Concrete Review role/states and the payroll trigger remain deferred.
- WorkspaceMember has no active flag and legacy membership/history semantics
  remain for later lifecycle work. Soft delete is not implemented.

### Blockers and exact continuation

There is no implementation blocker for the completed scope. The active gate is
owner review.

1. Review the three backend files, the delegated decisions and the 51/80-test
   evidence. Do not reopen the 14 accepted decisions unless the owner explicitly
   changes them.
2. Do not apply `workspace.0002` as part of this task. A future operational
   apply requires target-specific inventory, retention-appropriate backup and
   explicit authorization even though current development has no business rows.
3. Do not open Workspace or Invitation APIs in this worktree yet.
4. After owner approval, define a separately authorized next task. The expected
   next implementation slice is minimal Profile/Workspace read/API permission
   integration using this foundation, scheduled with the account-verification
   dependency; Invitation remains later.

Stop at `OWNER REVIEW GATE`. Do not start the next task automatically.

## Superseded checkpoint — 2026-10-17 (historical only)

Checkpoint: 2026-10-17

Repository: `D:\da\HustlyTasker`

Branch: `main`

HEAD and local `origin/main`: `5e89971`
Current task: `HT-RBAC-DESIGN-P0-01 — DESIGN READY / OWNER REVIEW GATE`

This historical checkpoint is retained only for traceability. Continue from
the current checkpoint above.
Read root `AGENTS.md` before taking action. Source code, migrations, Git status,
and current test results override any stale historical note.

## 1. Project and stack

HustlyTasker is a backend-first workflow system for content-production teams
and agencies.

- Backend: Python 3.12, Django 6.1.2
- API: Django REST Framework 3.18.3
- Database: PostgreSQL 16
- ORM: Django ORM
- Local database workflow: Docker Compose with named volume
  `docker_postgres_data`
- Authentication foundation: Django server-side sessions, CSRF, DRF
  `SessionAuthentication`
- Default API access: DRF `IsAuthenticated`; public endpoints must explicitly
  use reviewed `AllowAny`
- Frontend: planned React/Next.js, no frontend source implemented

Do not replace this stack, start frontend, or introduce another framework
without explicit owner approval.

## 2. Current implementation status

### Backend implemented

- Modular Django apps for accounts, workspace, tasks, reviews, clients,
  finance, notifications, and audit.
- Fourteen concrete initial domain models and eight domain
  `0001_initial.py` migrations.
- Environment-based Django/PostgreSQL/security/mailer configuration and a safe
  `.env.example`.
- PostgreSQL Compose workflow preserving the named volume.
- Session authentication API:
  `/api/auth/csrf/`, `register/`, `login/`, `logout/`, and `me/`.
- DRF deny-by-default policy and reviewed public allowlist.
- Public JSON-only `/api/health/` liveness endpoint; legacy `/api/test/` is
  removed.
- Accepted Profile/Workspace architecture: Profile is the company/team tenant
  root; Workspace is the monthly operational scope; User remains global.
- `Profile` and `ProfileMembership` foundation with Profile roles, uniqueness,
  indexes, multi-owner/last-owner services and membership audit events.
- Transitional nullable `Workspace.profile`, protected Workspace owner
  deletion, and same-Profile validation for validated Workspace writes.
- Additive `workspace/0002_profile_workspace_foundation.py` in source; it has
  run only on disposable PostgreSQL test databases.
- Reviewable `documentation/RBAC_DESIGN.md` with the proposed capability
  matrix, tenant-scoped request/query/service boundary, Profile Invitation
  contract, planned routes, negative/concurrency tests, open decisions, and
  dependency-ordered implementation plan. It is not runtime behavior.

### Not implemented

- Applying Workspace `0002` to the development database
- Workspace lifecycle/invitation API
- Workspace/Profile RBAC and object-scoped querysets
- Owner approval of the seven residual RBAC groups covering Workspace roles,
  Profile Admin/lifecycle, Task visibility/contributor membership, account/
  membership lifecycle, Invitation identity/operations, and error/operator policy
- Project model/API
- Client/Profile, Workspace-scoped Invoice, public-link and soft-delete schema
  migrations
- Task, Review, Client, Finance, Notification, or Audit business APIs
- Account activation/OTP, password recovery, and logout-all
- Frontend
- Backend container image, production deployment, or CI pipeline

Most business app `views.py` files remain scaffolds. Workspace now has focused
foundation tests, but global DRF authentication still proves identity only; it
does not provide tenant authorization.

## 3. Completed tasks and verification evidence

| Task | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| HT-OPS-P0-01 dependency synchronization | COMPLETE | Clean Python 3.12 install, `pip check`, Django check, dependency versions verified on 2026-10-13. |
| HT-SEC-P0-02 environment hardening | COMPLETE | Development and production-like checks, fail-fast env cases, migration checks, PostgreSQL smoke on 2026-10-13. |
| HT-AUTH-P0-01 authentication foundation | COMPLETE | 19 authentication/session/CSRF/throttle/admin tests and API smoke passed on 2026-10-14. |
| HT-API-P0-03 DRF/health foundation | COMPLETE | Full suite 29/29 (19 auth + 10 API), checks, migration consistency, runserver health/auth smoke passed on 2026-10-15. The same suite and non-server checks passed again on 2026-10-16. |
| Permanent documentation/handover foundation | COMPLETE | Root `AGENTS.md` and this handover checkpoint created on 2026-10-16. |
| HT-DATA-P2-01 Workspace architecture design | COMPLETE / ACCEPTED | Source/reference audit, alternatives, ownership matrix, invariants and migration plan completed; owner approved all 11 decision groups on 2026-10-16. |
| PROFILE/WORKSPACE SCHEMA FOUNDATION | COMPLETE | Foundation implemented and verified: targeted Workspace tests 32/32 and full PostgreSQL suite 61/61 pass; `pip check`, system check and migration drift check pass. Owner authorized the subsequent design task; `0002` intentionally remains unapplied to development. |
| HT-RBAC-DESIGN-P0-01 capability/scoping/invitation design | DESIGN READY / OWNER REVIEW GATE | Full evidence-labeled design in `RBAC_DESIGN.md`; reconciled against all 11 approved groups (all now `MATCH`); seven residual review groups only; source/migration/database unchanged; current PostgreSQL migration/data state reconfirmed read-only on 2026-10-17. |

Latest foundation verification on 2026-10-17: targeted `apps.workspace` tests
passed 32/32 and the complete PostgreSQL suite passed 61/61. The full run
includes 19 Authentication and 10 API Foundation regression tests. `pip check`,
Django system check, and `makemigrations --check --dry-run` passed. See
`PROGRESS.md` for dated evidence.

For `HT-RBAC-DESIGN-P0-01` on 2026-10-17, the final reconciliation QA passed:
the 11-row table and seven open-group structure are present; all nine affected
files pass strict UTF-8/no-NUL/code-fence and secret-pattern checks; and
`git diff --check` passes with only line-ending conversion warnings. No backend
code changed, so the 32/32 and 61/61 results above were not relabeled as a new
run. The local venv references a missing Python 3.12 installation and no
`py`/`python` exists on PATH; no replacement environment or new container was
created for this design-only checkpoint.

## 4. Active task checkpoint

`HT-RBAC-DESIGN-P0-01` has all requested design deliverables and is
`DESIGN READY — PENDING OWNER APPROVAL`. Stop here; this status is not approval
to implement RBAC, Workspace, Invitation, or another business API.

Work completed:

- Re-read requirements, accepted decisions, current models/services/admin,
  migrations, API routing/settings/tests, and relevant legacy discovery. The
  design marks each rule as requirement, approved, current, proposed, or open.
- Added `documentation/RBAC_DESIGN.md` with a full Profile/Workspace capability
  matrix. It preserves approved Owner/Admin inheritance and ordinary-Member
  explicit Workspace access while treating Workspace Admin/Viewer/Owner action
  semantics as proposals pending approval.
- Reconciled the complete RBAC design against all 11 owner-approved
  architecture groups. The original findings were 1–3/5/10 `MATCH`, group 4 a
  labeling `CONFLICT`, and groups 6–9/11 `NOT DOCUMENTED` in part or whole.
  The conflict was corrected back to “at least one active Owner membership”;
  every missing approved boundary was added. All 11 now read as `MATCH` without
  asking the owner to approve them again.
- Defined a fail-closed per-request Profile context, scoped Workspace and
  child-resource querysets, same-tenant request-body resolution, and proposed
  non-enumerating `404`/`403`/generic `400` behavior.
- Defined service/transaction enforcement, Profile-first lock order, database
  versus service responsibilities, and controls for direct ORM, bulk writes,
  jobs, Django Admin, User deactivation, and platform-operator access.
- Identified a concrete pre-API issue: `update_profile_membership()` globally
  resolves membership ID; `add_workspace_member()` globally resolves Workspace
  ID and accepts an already-resolved unscoped target User before actor scope.
  They have no HTTP route today, but implementation must refactor both
  boundaries before exposure to avoid an IDOR existence oracle.
- Defined the Profile Invitation aggregate, recipient/authority boundary,
  `PENDING` terminal transitions, 256-bit token/hash-at-rest rules, CSRF and
  account binding, duplicate/replay/concurrency behavior, audit events,
  proposed routes, and negative tests. Invitation acceptance never creates a
  Workspace membership automatically.
- Defined dependency order from owner approval through safe `0002` apply,
  access primitives, membership-service refactor, minimal endpoints, future
  additive Invitation migration/API, and later business domains.
- Reconfirmed PostgreSQL through read-only SQL on 2026-10-17: only
  `workspace.0001_initial` is applied; 3 Users and 0 Profile, membership,
  Workspace, Task, Client, Invoice, Payment, or AuditLog business rows;
  `workspace.0002` remains unapplied. Existing Docker/PostgreSQL state was
  returned to stopped; no migration or data write occurred.

Work pending at this checkpoint:

- Owner review/edits of the seven genuinely open groups in
  `RBAC_DESIGN.md`: Workspace role/action ceiling; Profile Admin/lifecycle
  authority; Task visibility/contributor attribution; Profile/account/
  membership lifecycle; Invitation identity/role ceiling; Invitation
  operations/retention; and API error/operator policy.
- Development database migration apply is still a separate operational gate.
  Do not apply `0002` merely because the current inventory has no business rows.
- There is no blocker to reviewing the design. The unresolved owner decisions
  intentionally block implementation, not completion of this review package.

Deliberately not implemented in this design task:

- No access context, queryset selector, permission class, RBAC, or Workspace API.
- No Invitation model/migration/service/API or email delivery flow.
- No Client/Profile, Finance, public-link, AuditLog-tenant or soft-delete schema
  was added.
- No User/authentication mechanism, model, migration, database row, frontend,
  or runtime API contract was changed.

## 5. Current ownership facts and gaps

| Entity | Current source truth | Gap before business API |
|---|---|---|
| User | Global Django identity | Profile access is separate; no auth-model change. |
| Profile | Company/team tenant root exists in source | No soft-delete lifecycle or API. |
| ProfileMembership | Partial unique active Profile/User; inactive history; OWNER/ADMIN/MEMBER | Invitation lifecycle/API absent; aggregate last-owner invariant depends on service use; direct User deactivation/ORM mutation can bypass it. |
| Workspace | Nullable protected Profile FK plus transitional protected owner User | Development migration unapplied; FK remains nullable for safe legacy transition; old Workspace role/owner representation remains. |
| WorkspaceMember | Unique Workspace/User with OWNER/ADMIN/MEMBER/VIEWER; persistence validation plus audited direct-add service | No invitation lifecycle/API; bulk/raw writes remain outside the service boundary; inactive Profile membership does not erase historical WorkspaceMember rows. |
| Task | Required Workspace and creator User | Creator/member relationship is not enforced. |
| Assignment/Comment | Derive Workspace through Task | Actor membership is not enforced. |
| Deliverable/Review | Derive Workspace through Task | Uploader/reviewer membership is not enforced. |
| Client | No tenant FK | Cannot be safely tenant-filtered. |
| ShareLink | Client only; raw unique token | Client is global; no hash/revoke/capability/creator contract. |
| Invoice/Payment | Current schema still derives through global Client | Approved target is Invoice→Workspace plus same-Profile Client, but migration is not implemented. |
| Notification | User recipient | No structured tenant/resource context. |
| AuditLog | Optional User + generic entity ID | No reliable tenant path or target integrity. |

There is no current Workspace/business API, so the new foundation does not
claim complete tenant authorization. Django Admin currently uses global model
querysets and must be treated as a platform-operations surface, not a tenant
admin UI.

## 6. Accepted architecture decisions

The following are accepted and implemented:

- Modular Django architecture under `backend/apps/`.
- PostgreSQL with the existing Docker workflow.
- Django server-side session authentication for the current same-origin API.
- DRF session authentication plus global `IsAuthenticated` deny-by-default.
- Explicit reviewed `AllowAny` for health, CSRF bootstrap, registration, and
  login only.
- `/api/health/` is process liveness, not database readiness.

The owner also accepted these tenancy/business boundaries on 2026-10-16:

- Profile represents a company/team and is the tenant root; Workspace is its
  monthly operational scope.
- User may join multiple Profiles. Switching selected Profile is navigation,
  not authorization.
- Profile roles are OWNER/ADMIN/MEMBER. Profile Owner/Admin administer all
  Workspaces in that Profile; ordinary Members need explicit Workspace access;
  nothing is inherited across Profiles.
- Profiles support multiple equal Owners and always retain at least one active
  Owner; Owner changes are transactional and Admin cannot change Owners.
- Joining Profile requires invitation acceptance. Direct Workspace add is
  allowed only for an already-active Profile member; material changes are
  audited and active memberships do not duplicate.
- Client belongs to Profile; a Client has Projects; a Project may span monthly
  Workspaces through Tasks. Task remains in one Workspace and all referenced
  Client/Project/Workspace records must share one Profile.
- Invoice belongs to one Workspace and same-Profile Client; Payment belongs to
  Invoice. Numbering and detailed billing are deferred.
- Client Portal supports account and secure-link access; its link and Guest
  Review link are separate hashed, scoped, expiring and revocable principals.
  Client accounts receive no internal membership automatically.
- Soft delete is the target default for Profile, Workspace, Client, Project
  and Task; hard delete is controlled, finance/audit history is protected, and
  User departure does not cascade-delete business data. Retention duration and
  purge remain deferred.
- Migration requires inventory, no guessed mapping, backup/rehearsal for risky
  data, and new migrations only.
- High-level Task workflow is assignment → work → Deliverable → Review →
  approval/completion or revision/resubmission. Task completes only after its
  Deliverable is approved. Exact states, approvers and payroll trigger are
  deferred.

## 7. Approved target and remaining decisions

Accepted target:

```text
User (global identity)
  ↕ ProfileMembership
Profile / Organization (tenant root)
  ├─ Workspace (operational/monthly scope)
  │    └─ Task → Deliverable/Review
  ├─ Client / CRM → Project (may span monthly Workspaces through Tasks)
  ├─ Workspace → Invoice → Payment (Client must share Profile)
  └─ tenant AuditLog
```

Client Portal and Guest Review remain separate principals/link aggregates and
are not Workspace roles.

Still requires later task decisions:

RBAC owner-review gate (seven groups):

1. Workspace role vocabulary and action ceiling.
2. Profile Admin and Profile/Workspace lifecycle authority.
3. Task visibility and contributor-membership requirement.
4. Profile/account/membership lifecycle, including self-service eligibility,
   leave/rejoin, history, and account/session mechanics. Initial-Owner creation
   already exists and is not pending re-approval.
5. Invitation identity, onboarding, grant/management role ceiling, including
   whether invitations can ever request `OWNER` (proposal: no).
6. Invitation TTL/reinvite/throttle/delivery, inviter revalidation, optional
   combined UX that preserves the two fixed transitions, and record retention.
7. Non-enumerating error/`409` and platform-operator/Django Admin policy.

Separate downstream decisions: Invoice numbering/billing; Client Portal/Guest
Review exact capabilities/account linking/default expiry; retention/legal hold/
purge; and exact Task/Review states, approvers, and payroll trigger. An unknown
tenant mapping becomes a target-environment blocker only when inventory finds
such a row; the approved policy is already to never guess it.

Detailed proposal and owner-review checklist: `documentation/RBAC_DESIGN.md`.
Accepted rationale and proposal status: `documentation/DECISION_LOG.md`.

Current source/development state versus accepted target:
`documentation/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`.

## 8. Git and uncommitted work to preserve

Repository evidence on 2026-10-17:

- Branch, `HEAD`, and local `origin/main` are `main` / `5e89971`. That existing
  owner commit contains the previously completed environment, authentication,
  API, schema-foundation, and initial RBAC-design work.
- This reconciliation did not commit, push, reset, rewrite history, edit
  backend source, or touch the database.
- `git status --short --untracked-files=all` currently reports exactly nine
  modified tracked documentation files and no untracked files:
  `CHANGELOG.md`, `DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`, `DECISION_LOG.md`, `HANDOVER.md`,
  `PROGRESS.md`, `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `PROJECT_ROADMAP.md`, `RBAC_DESIGN.md`,
  and `REQUIREMENT_STATUS.md` under `documentation/`.
- `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` is unchanged because no runtime API contract changed.

Preserve all nine documentation changes. Before any future edit, rerun
`git status --short --untracked-files=all`; do not use reset/checkout/clean to
make the tree appear clean.

## 9. Environment setup and test commands

The complete Windows/PowerShell onboarding flow is in root `README.md`.

At this checkpoint on 2026-10-17, the development database was queried read-only and
contained 0 business rows and 3 User rows. The named volume was preserved.
Migration `workspace.0002_profile_workspace_foundation` was applied only in
disposable Django test databases and not in development. Future sessions must
inspect Docker and migration state rather than assume either is unchanged.

1. Copy `.env.example` to the ignored `.env` and fill only local values. Never
   paste real values into documentation or Git.
2. Load `.env` into the current PowerShell process using the validated loader
   block in `README.md`.
3. Start PostgreSQL without replacing its named volume:

   ```powershell
   docker compose --env-file .env -f docker/docker-compose.yml config --quiet
   docker compose --env-file .env -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d postgres
   ```

4. Create/activate a fresh Python 3.12 virtual environment if the existing
   local venv is broken, then install:

   ```powershell
   py -3.12 -m venv backend/venv
   .\backend\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   python -m pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   ```

5. With environment variables loaded:

   ```powershell
   Set-Location backend
   python -m pip check
   python manage.py check
   python manage.py makemigrations --check --dry-run
   python manage.py test -v 2
   ```

`migrate --check` is expected to report the unapplied Workspace `0002` until an
approved development apply occurs. Do not run `migrate` against an unknown
database, reset the named volume, or reuse production credentials for tests.
Django tests must use a disposable test database.

## 10. Exact safe continuation

Current review gate: `HT-RBAC-DESIGN-P0-01` deliverables are ready. Stop before
Workspace API/RBAC/Invitation implementation until the owner approves or edits
the proposal in `RBAC_DESIGN.md`.

1. Owner reviews only the seven open decision groups in `RBAC_DESIGN.md`. Do
   not request re-approval of the reconciled 11 architecture groups; all now
   match the authoritative accepted decision.
2. Record accepted answers in `DECISION_LOG.md`; proposals remain proposals
   until then. Do not silently select defaults from legacy reference material.
3. If implementation is authorized, repeat Git/source/database inventory.
   Treat the prior 32/32 targeted and 61/61 full PostgreSQL runs as historical
   evidence and rerun checks after any source change.
4. Apply `workspace.0002` only as a separately approved operational step after
   target-specific inventory and backup policy. Preserve nullable legacy rows
   and never synthesize a Profile for unknown data.
5. Proposed first implementation slice of existing `HT-RBAC-P1-03` after
   approval: Tenant Access Context and Scoped Service Foundation. Implement
   scoped selectors/error mapping, refactor the two unsafe membership service
   boundaries, and add IDOR/concurrency tests before opening broad Workspace
   CRUD. Invitation schema/API follows only after its open decisions.

Do not implement Workspace API/RBAC, Invitation, Project/Client/Finance
migration, public-link flows, soft delete, Task workflow, or frontend in this
task. Do not commit, push, reset, rewrite history, or migrate development.
